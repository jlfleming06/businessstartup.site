			<P>Coaching is a process that enables executives, managers and staff to achieve their full potential. Coaching and mentoring are similar in nature. Let’s look at some of the things your business coach will do for you, your staff and your business. <br>
<br>
* Will teach clients to creatively apply techniques and tools. This includes things like facilitating, doing one-on-one training, counseling and networking.<br>
<br>
* Encourages clients to a commitment to action and the development of growth and change that’s lasting.<br>
<br>
* Encouraging clients to constantly advance competencies and to expand developmental association whenever necessary to attain their goals.<br>
<br>
* Ensure that clients build their personal competencies and that they don’t build unhealthy dependencies on the coaching relationship.<br>
<br>
* Evaluate the outcome of the process, with the use of objective measures when possible to make sure the relationship thrives and the client is achieving their goals both personal and work related.<br>
<br>
* Facilitate the exploration of the clients needs, desires, motivations, skills and the thought process to assist the client in making real and lasting changes.<br>
<br>
* Preserve positive unconditional regard for the client, which means that the coach is always non judgmental and supportive of the client, their aspirations and views.<br>
<br>
* Management of the relationship to make sure the client get a suitable level of service and that the program isn’t too long or too short.<br>
<br>
* Observe the client, listen and ask questions to understand the situation of the client.<br>
<br>
* Use questioning techniques to make possible the client's own thought processes to identify solutions and actions rather than using a direct approach.<br>
<br>
* Proven coaching training practices can bolster trust, strengthen relationships and commitment, and enjoy the benefits of open communication. <br>
<br>
* Give meaningful feedback to clients on the best way to communicate requests and suggestions to others? <br>
<br>
* Provide skill to build trust and acceptance.<br>
<br>
* Teach clients how to use questions to achieve the best performance. <br>
<br>
* Examine the behaviors that will lead to unreliable behavior and the inability to achieve the client’s goals.<br>
<br>
Business coaching is a valuable tool where a trained professional comes into a business no matter what the business size to work with executives, managers, and staff so that they can create their goals and achieve those goals, so that they can grow and expand their skills and improve their role in the workplace achieving their goals.</P>
